== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What makes this plugin different from other optimization plugins? =

We just bring some helper functions from our core theme and release it under a single plugin. There is big advantage when using it with our core theme, but it should be better in most other themes.

= Should it work with my current theme? =

Certainly. We just use filters/actions hooks.

= Should I use it this plugin instead of caching plugin? =

No, if you are using other themes.
Yes, if you are using our themes.
